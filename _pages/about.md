  I have completed a Bachelorâ€™s and Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Chiao Tung University and am currently pursuing a second Master's degree in Computer Science while working. My research focuses on using machine learning to achieve virtual try-on. <br>

Besides, I am also very interested in developing Python and iOS projects. I hope to create projects that are both interesting and useful.
